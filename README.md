# Solutions for specific desires

Created custom png for expo splash screen (./assets/V11.png)
Used react-animated-splash-screen and react-native-progress for custom splash screen(Couldn't find the same loading indicator animation but tried to make it as same as possible)
Used react-native-validator for email validation
Couldn't change the password style because ReactNative doesn't have an option for this and didn't wanted to use custom TextInput for compatibility purposes
